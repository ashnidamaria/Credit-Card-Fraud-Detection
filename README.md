# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Building various machine learning models for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.

Problem Statement:

Finex is a leading financial service provider based out of Florida, US. It offers a wide range of products and business services to customers through different channels, ranging from in-person banking and ATMs to online banking. Over the last few years, Finex has observed that a significantly large number of unauthorised transactions are being made, due to which the bank has been facing a huge revenue and profitability crisis. Many customers have been complaining about unauthorised transactions being made through their credit/debit cards. It has been reported that fraudsters use stolen/lost cards and hack private systems to access the personal and sensitive data of many cardholders. They also indulge in ATM skimming at various POS terminals such as gas stations, shopping malls, and ATMs that do not send alerts or do not have OTP systems through banks. Such fraudulent activities have been reported to happen during non-peak and odd hours of the day leaving no room for suspicion.

In most cases, customers get to know of such unauthorised transactions happening through their cards quite late as they are unaware of such ongoing credit card frauds or they do not monitor their bank account activities closely. This has led to late complaint registration with Finex and by the time the case is flagged fraudulent, the bank incurs heavy losses and ends up paying the lost amount to the cardholders.

Now, Finex is also not really equipped with the latest financial technologies, and it is becoming difficult for the bank to track these data breaches on time to prevent further losses. The Branch Manager is worried about the ongoing situation and wants to identify the possible root causes and action areas to come up with a long-term solution that would help the bank generate high revenue with minimal losses.

Goal:

Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions based on the historical transactional data of customers with a pool of merchants.Based on your understanding of the model, you have to analyse the business impact of these fraudulent transactions and recommend the optimal ways that the bank can adopt to mitigate the fraud risks.
